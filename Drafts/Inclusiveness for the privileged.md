The WWDC Keynote went as expected. Apple's platforms are continuing to evolve in a way I like. Many new features, new APIs, some Messages.app gimmicks and _cool_ UI tweaks. 

WWDC 2016 was yet another tech product announcement presentation which can be summed up as „cool gimmicks for the >1% of population”.

It is normal for the most valuable company in the world to deliver gimmicks. A multi billion organization is praised for delivering rich messaging experience.

# Accessibility and Diversity

Apple regularly boasts of diversity culture and accessibility features. Apple Watch has a mode for users on wheelchairs, there were mentions of successful app stories from people of color and there were a few women presenting on stage.

On the other hand, Apple is a luxury brand. iPhones and Macs are high end devices. The luxury is reflected in prices which make their technology super inaccessible.


# Inclusiveness for the privileged

If we compare cost of an Apple device to average income in various places, it doesn't take a certified statistician to see that very few people can afford it. I am in the fortunate >1% of the world. But what part of disabled people can afford it? What tiny fraction of people of color?

At one point they showed an iPhone app made by a black woman (presumably in Africa) which educates about pregnancy. Do you sense the tragicomedy here? The underlying message was that the technology they provide can save lives there. The technology which costs about as much as average yearly income of a person in sub-saharan Africa. 

There were so many scenes of people of color. So many scenes from poor countries. The message of Apple is `we solve the problems of those most in need`. Technology that hardly anyone can buy.

The last highlight of the evening was Swift Playgrounds. I'm not a fan of the way Apple does software development in general but they look neat. A fun way to learn basics of programming. Now, it looks great, but fails at the same point as other „miracle” technologies. It is accessible for very few.

# Let's lift the bar

Apple is the most valuable company in the world yet it is not expected to invent for common good. Other companies do slightly better. Facebook and Google are supporting development of the Internet.

Yes, you might say that Facebook's `Internet.org` is bullshit because it redefines the Internet to few websites. You might say that Google is an evil spy. Agreed, but do they provide value? Shouldn't this be what we expect from those companies? Isn't it a better, more satisfying way to utilize those great minds who work there? 

Who should we expect to be the change? Who has greatest assets to be the change? There might be many answers to these questions but technology companies is one of them for me. 

There's so much unlocked potential in people who don't have access to technology. Let's raise the bar, let's expect more, for common good.
