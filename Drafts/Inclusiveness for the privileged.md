WWDC week is over. As much as I appreciate Apple products, what struck me was their marketing language. It is disconnected from the reality. Silicon Valley's of <your idea here> revolutioninzing the world is funny but when corporations use this language it becomes staggering. 

# Diversity and Accessibility

Apple boasts of diversity culture. There were mentions of successful app stories from people of color and there were a few women on stage. The 9 years old WWDC attendee was also one of the highlights of the week.

Apple is also a leader in accessibility features. This year, notably, a mode for users on wheelchairs has been added to the watch. There were also a few sessions on this topic.

# Inclusiveness for the privileged

The inspirational video for „the future generation of developers” had the message that your app can revolutionize life of everyone. As much as I would like this to be true inaccessibility of Apple devices makes it impossible. The technology which costs about as much as average yearly income of a person in sub-saharan Africa. Every second person makes 700 dollars or less. (Data needed here). When I was watching this video for the first time, I felt as if I was watching another episode of the Silicon Valley series.

I am in the fortunate >1% of the world who can afford an iPhone. If you are reading this, it is likely that you are part among these people too. But what part of disabled people can afford it? What tiny fraction of people of color? 

# Apple's DNA

Apple as a luxury brand used to have the message of providing the best experience on the market. Now they are transitioning into providing the best experience for everyone which is simply not true.

It's hard to revolutionize every few years but it's not impossible. I expect a little bit more from a billion dollar organization than a new messaging experience. It's worth noting that we **need** luxurious brands. They don't have to sacrifice high quality for price. They have the comfort of making bold move regardless what the market expects. Especially if they have such loyal customers.

It would be great if they could build high quality, revolutionizing products with a low price, but I .
