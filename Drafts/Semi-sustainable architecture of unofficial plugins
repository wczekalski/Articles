# (Not only) Xcode plugin architecture

Xcode plugin architecture should focus on separat`ion of concerns between the plugin functionality and Xcode-characteristic classes.

If you have trouble with this just ask yourself what is __the thing__ I want to do differently than Xcode. What is the functionality I want to add? The answer is the separated part.

Hacks under the hood are better than _bad_ architecture.
